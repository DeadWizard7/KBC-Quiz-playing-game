# KBC-Quiz-playing-game
A console-based interactive quiz game inspired by the popular Indian television game show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). This project is written in Python and simulates a question-and-answer game with increasing prize money for each correct answer.This game tests the userâ€™s general knowledge across a series of 10 questions, with multiple-choice answers. The user is rewarded with increasing virtual cash for each correct answer and exits the game immediately upon giving a wrong answer. The player's progress is stored in a simulated PIGI bank, and the total winning amount is calculated at the end if all answers are correct.
